About the dataset: 

The village market has a section dedicated to fish - and there are a variety of fish available there. 
This dataset contains the details of fish that is brought into the market. 
The fish is valued for its weight and size.

To do:

1) What insights do you get from the data?

2) Make a model that predicts the weight of fish that comes into the market. 

3) Is the length and width of the fish always associated to the weight?

4) Can you come up with an idea for pricing of fish?
